If the [[Partial Transpose]] of the density matrix $\rho^{T_B}$ is positive, i.e., all of its eigenvalues are positive, then $\rho$ is called positive partial transpose (PPT) state

## Properties
- [[Separable State|Separable states]] must have positive partial transpose
- For 2-qubit or 1 qubit-1 qutrit systems, PPT states are necessarily separable
