Given $N$ copies of the quantum state $\rho$ shared between $A$ and $B$, if $\rho^{\otimes N}$ can be reduced to a [[Singlet State|singlet state]] with local quantum operations and classical communications, then state $\rho$ is called distillable, and the process is called distillation.
- Does not require distillation to succeed 100% of the time, but requires that we need to know if it succeeds
