## Full Notes
### Preface
- ðŸŒ±Focus: applications to solid, mainly using plane-wave DFT
### 1 What is Density Functional Theory
#### 1.1 How to Approach This Book
#### 1.2 Examples of DFT in Action
##### 1.2.1 Ammonia Synthesis by Heterogenous Catalysis 
- DFT was used to calculate and predict the optimal shape and size for Ru catalyst for the ammonia synthesis process
##### 1.2.2 Embrittlement of Metals by Trace Impurities 
##### 1.2.3 Materials Properties for Modeling Planetary Formation 
- General impactful use of DFT
	- Understanding systems that are hard to achieve in experiments
	- Understanding the underlying mechanism of the physical phenomena
#### 1.3 The SchrÃ¶dinger Equation
- We solve the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the many-body wave function so that we could compute the properties of the system
- Practical considerations
	- We only observe the probabilities, not the wave function
	- We cannot label each individual particles, due to indistinguishability 
- In experiments, we are interested in the particle density $n {\pqty{\vb{r}}}$ 
	- The particle density contains information about the full many-body wave function 
#### 1.4 Density Functional Theoryâ€”From Wave Functions to Electron Density
