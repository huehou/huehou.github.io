## Full Notes
### I Introduction
- Atomtronics: Using cold atoms as matter waves to build circuits
	- High flexibility and control 
	- Can be used as cold-atom quantum simulators 
	- Analogues of electronics or quantum electronic components
		- AQUIDS as an example
		- Can build components beyond analogues of known electronic components 
	- Applications in quantum sensing 
		- Build interferometers sensitive to inertial forces and electromagnetic fields 
### II Traps and Guides
#### A. Optical potentials
- The potentials can have any shape 
	- Done using electric dipole interaction between the atoms and lasers
##### 1. Static laser beams
- Usually cylindrically symmetric 
##### 2. Time-averaged optical potentials
- The "painted potential" approach allows flexible choice of 2D potentials
- Limitations
	- Painting must be fast enough, limiting the trapping frequencies 
##### 3. Spatial light modulators and digital micromirror devices 
- SLM usually uses liquid crystal modulators to create holograms of the potential 
- DMD is formed with an array of binary matrix of mirrors 
#### B. Magnetic potentials
##### 1. Magnetic traps
- The most common traps:
	- Ioffe-Pritchard (IP) trap
		- Consists of a radial quadrupole and an axial parabolic field 
	- Time-orbiting potential (TOP) trap
		- Uses a static magnetic quadrupole field with a rotating
##### 2. Atom chips
- Consists of transverse homogeneous magnetic field with a current-carrying wire
	- Different wire shapes will produce different complicated magnetic field trap structures 
	- Easy to cool by placing it on top of cold substrate
	- Compact and easy to manipulate
- Downside: very susceptible to noise and erors
##### 3. Adiabatic magnetic potentials
- A radiofrequency field strongly couples magnetic hyperfine states
##### 4. Time-averaged adiabatic potentials (TAAPs)
- Combining adiabatic magnetic potentials with oscillating homogeneous magnetic field
- You can trap two spin components into the same identical potential trap
	- Applications in atom interferometry, where they could be separated, then recombined to make a highly sensitive interferometer 
	- ðŸ“š [Navez et al., 2016] and [Stevenson et al., 2015] 
- TAAP generates its field from distant sources, so it is less likely to be susceptible to nearby errors
#### C. Atom optical elements
##### 1. Waveguides 
##### 2. Ring traps
- Near the trap minimum, the potential energy can be viewed as $$
	U = \frac{1}{2} m \omega_{\rho}^2 {\pqty{\rho- \rho_0}}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega_z^2 z^2 \,,
$$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\omega_{\rho}$ and $\omega_z$ are the harmonic trapping frequencies in the radial and vertical directions, respectively. 
- Two regimes:
	- Small radius where the excitations along the circumference is important
	- Circular waveguide 
- Experimental achievements:
	- Smooth potentials of ring radii and lattice spacings of 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ and 30 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ respectively
	- Ring radius of 40 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ and lattice spacing 4 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ 
	- Not small enough to have appreciable tunneling 
##### 3. Barriers and beam splitters
- We make beam splitters using both time-dependent and time-independent potentials, while we make barriers using time-independent potentials 
- It is difficult to construct barriers and beam splitters using purely magnetic approaches; use optical or hybrid magnetic and optical or radio-frequency approaches 
#### III. Coherent Effects in Mesoscopic Matter-wave Circuits
