## Full Notes
### 1 
- Accepted at the time: $\alpha$ and $\beta$ deflections are due to multiple small scatterings in the atoms
	- Geiger and Marsden deduced from experiment that some $\alpha$ particles deflect for more than $90^\circ$ after just one encounter
	- If it were due to multiple small scatterings, the most probable deflect angle should be around $0.87^\circ$, and it is highly unlikely for the deflection angle to be larger than $90^\circ$ 
	- To produce large deflect angles after one encounter suggests that the atom consists of a centre with large electric charge
- J. J. Thomson's model: $N$ negative particles with $N$ positive particles distributed uniformly 
	- If we assume only small deflection is allowed and we observe large number of scattering events, we can infer that the number of electrons in an atom is 3 times its atomic weight
	- J. J. Thomson's model could not account for large deflection angles 
- Through scattering of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ particles, we can infer the atomic structure
